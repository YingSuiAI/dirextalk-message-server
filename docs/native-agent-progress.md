- [x] Runtime CLI run executes with bounded timeout and returns stdout/stderr/exit status.

## Verification

- [x] `go test ./p2p ./internal/productpolicy -count=1`.
- [x] `go test ./internal/httputil ./setup -count=1`.
- [x] `go test ./syncapi/storage ./syncapi/routing -count=1` if sync reader code is touched.
- [x] `go build ./cmd/dirextalk-message-server`.
- [x] `docker compose -f docker-compose.p2p.yml config`.
- [x] `python3 -m json.tool docs/postman/dirextalk-message-server.postman_collection.json >/dev/null`.
- [x] `git diff --check`.

## Real Interface Acceptance

- [x] Local service starts for native Agent testing.
- [x] Owner token installs/enables native Agent.
- [x] DeepSeek `plugins.invoke -> agent.chat` returns a Chinese reply.
- [x] DeepSeek `client.plugin_stream -> agent.chat.stream` emits `delta` and `done`.
- [x] Test skill install/list works and changes system prompt behavior.
- [x] Test MCP server install/list works and tool is callable.
- [x] Runtime CLI install/which/run works.
- [x] Built-in contacts, rooms, message list, summarize, and send tools are exercised.
- [x] Temporary DeepSeek key is absent from logs, docs, git diff, persisted config, and test output.

## Eino Correction

- [x] Eino examples were downloaded locally and reviewed before correcting implementation.
- [x] Eino latest stable core (`v0.9.12`), Eino OpenAI model, Eino DeepSeek model, Eino official MCP, and `modelcontextprotocol/go-sdk` dependencies are added.
- [x] Native Agent model/tool loop uses Eino ReAct instead of the previous hand-written loop.
- [x] OpenAI, DeepSeek, and OpenAI-compatible providers use Eino model components.
- [x] Anthropic uses a direct-only Eino `ToolCallingChatModel` adapter and does not introduce AWS/Google SDK dependencies.
- [x] Built-in Dirextalk tools are wrapped as Eino `InvokableTool` implementations.
- [x] Third-party MCP tools use Eino official MCP and the official Go MCP SDK transports.
- [x] Conversation memory stores Eino `schema.Message` history captured from ReAct `WithMessageFuture`.
- [x] Context compaction runs through Eino message rewriting and optional Eino model summarization.
- [x] Installed runtime CLI tools are exposed as Eino tools and covered by an Agent loop test.
- [x] Eino-specific native Agent unit tests pass: `go test ./p2p/nativeagent -count=1`.
- [x] Full backend verification has been rerun after the Eino correction.
- [x] Real interface acceptance has been rerun after the Eino correction.
- [x] Final diff and secret scan have been rerun after the Eino correction.

## Extended Agent-Reach And Context7 Smoke

- [x] Agent-Reach skill was installed through `plugins.invoke -> agent.skills.install` from the GitHub `SKILL.md`.
- [x] Agent-Reach runtime CLI was installed/registered through `plugins.invoke -> agent.runtime.install`.
- [x] Bilibili runtime search tool was installed through `agent.runtime.install` and called through `agent.runtime.run`.
- [x] DeepSeek/Eino `agent.chat` called `runtime__agent_reach` and `runtime__bili`, then summarized Bilibili Shanghai food-guide results.
- [x] Context7 was installed through `plugins.invoke -> agent.mcp.servers.install`.
- [x] DeepSeek/Eino `agent.chat` called Context7 MCP tools and answered from retrieved Gin documentation.
- [x] XiaoHongShu and Twitter/X runtime tools were invoked and returned real missing-prerequisite output for login/cookies/native CLI dependency setup.
- [ ] Authenticated XiaoHongShu search succeeds after `xhs` cookies or `xiaohongshu-mcp` QR login backend is configured.
- [ ] Authenticated Twitter/X search succeeds after `twitter-cli` cookies/login are configured.

## Dialogue Management Tools

- [x] Native skill management tools are exposed to Eino conversations through the same `enabledTools` pipeline as Dirextalk tools.
- [x] Native skill management tools stay available when older config/request `enabled_tools` values list only the original Dirextalk tools.
- [x] Agent model loop can install a skill during `agent.chat`, persist it, and make it available to the next system prompt.
- [x] Native MCP server management tools are exposed to Eino conversations through the same `enabledTools` pipeline as Dirextalk tools.
- [x] Native MCP server management tools stay available when older config/request `enabled_tools` values list only the original Dirextalk tools.
- [x] Agent model loop can install an HTTP MCP server during `agent.chat`, discover tools, and persist it for the next turn.

## Extended DeepSeek Multi-Scenario Smoke

- [x] Multiple enabled skills were installed and listed through `plugins.invoke`: content skills plus GitHub Agent-Reach.
- [x] Runtime tools were installed through `agent.runtime.install` while using temporary China mirrors only in the smoke run.
- [x] DeepSeek `agent.chat` used enabled skill prompt behavior and returned observable `trace`/`steps`.
- [x] Local HTTP MCP server was installed through `agent.mcp.servers.install`, discovered, called by DeepSeek, and summarized in the final answer.
- [x] Context7 MCP was installed and called by DeepSeek in the same native Eino tool framework.
- [x] Conversation memory was retained, compressed through `agent.context.compress`, and reused by a later DeepSeek chat.
- [x] WS `client.plugin_stream` emitted streamed `delta`, `trace`, and `done` events, and the trace showed the runtime tool call.
- [x] Temporary mirror/proxy settings were restored after the smoke run and were not written to repository code.
