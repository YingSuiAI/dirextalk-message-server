# Dirextalk Message Server

Dirextalk Message Server is the backend contract authority for Dirextalk. It combines a Matrix-compatible homeserver, the Dirextalk ProductCore action API, product policy, projection/read models, Native Agent, external MCP access, and PostgreSQL-backed runtime storage in one Go monolith.

It is based on Element Dendrite, but this repository is maintained as a Dirextalk product server rather than a general-purpose Matrix homeserver distribution.

## Architecture

Each user owns a private Dirextalk service node. Personal nodes federate messages directly, while the Dirextalk Platform is limited to activation, distribution, and authorized public-discovery metadata.

![Dirextalk platform architecture](docs/assets/dirextalk-platform-architecture.png)

Inside each personal node:

- Matrix remains the source of truth for rooms, membership, ordinary messages, media, history, search, unread state, and redaction.
- ProductCore actions provide the product-facing facade for auth, parameter validation, remote forwarding, Matrix write orchestration, and projection reads.
- P2P tables are projection/read models unless a documented domain rule makes a table authoritative.
- Native Agent and `POST /mcp` are backend-owned capabilities. They are not installed, configured, or invoked through the plugin lifecycle.

## Runtime

- Production entry point: `cmd/dirextalk-message-server`
- Compatibility entry point: `cmd/dendrite`
- Docker image: `dirextalk/message-server:latest`
- Default config path in Docker: `/etc/dirextalk-message-server/message-server.yaml`
- Default data path in Docker: `/var/dirextalk-message-server`
- Go module: `github.com/YingSuiAI/dirextalk-message-server`
- Go version: `1.26.5`
- Server database: PostgreSQL only. SQLite/file DSNs are not supported server runtimes.
- Docker development database: PostgreSQL 18

## API Surface

Matrix protocol routes remain under:

- `/_matrix/*`
- `/_synapse/*`
- `/_dendrite/*`
- `/.well-known/matrix/*`

Dirextalk product APIs use the body-action surface:

- `GET /_p2p/health`
- `POST /_p2p/query`
- `POST /_p2p/command`
- `POST /mcp`
- `GET /_p2p/ws`
- `GET /.well-known/portal/owner.json`

The generated ProductCore contract is [docs/product-action-contract.json](docs/product-action-contract.json). At this revision it lists 148 actions: 11 public actions, 136 owner actions, and 1 agent action.

Authentication and transport boundaries:

- Owner product actions use `Authorization: Bearer <access_token>`.
- Logged-in clients prefer `GET /_p2p/ws` with `client.request`/`server.response`; when realtime is not ready, safe actions can fall back to `POST /_p2p/query` or `POST /_p2p/command`.
- `GET /_p2p/ws` accepts short-lived owner WebSocket tickets, not raw bearer tokens.
- `agent_token` can call only `agent.matrix_session.create` through the ProductCore body-action surface and the standard `POST /mcp` endpoint.
- External MCP clients use JSON-RPC over `POST /mcp`, currently for `initialize`, `tools/list`, and `tools/call`. The endpoint accepts `Authorization: Bearer <agent_token>`; owner tokens and query-string bearer tokens are rejected.

Product requests use this envelope:

```json
{
  "action": "channels.public.get",
  "params": {
    "room_id": "!room:dendrite-a:8448",
    "remote_node_base_url": "https://dendrite-a:8448/_p2p"
  }
}
```

## Local Development

Run commands from the repository root. PowerShell, Bash on Linux, Bash on macOS, and Bash in WSL are all supported; choose the command form that matches the shell you are using.

PostgreSQL-backed tests require a local PostgreSQL instance. The Go test helper creates isolated `dendrite_test_*` databases and drops them when each test finishes.

Build the server:

```bash
go build ./cmd/dirextalk-message-server
go build ./cmd/dendrite
```

Run the single-node Docker stack:

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.p2p.yml up --build
docker compose -f docker-compose.p2p.yml exec message-server cat /var/dirextalk-message-server/p2p/bootstrap.json
```

Run the three-node regression stack.

PowerShell:

```powershell
$env:P2P_DUAL_PUBLIC_HOST = if ($env:P2P_DUAL_PUBLIC_HOST) { $env:P2P_DUAL_PUBLIC_HOST } else { "host.docker.internal" }
docker compose -f docker-compose.p2p-dual.yml up -d --force-recreate dendrite-a dendrite-b dendrite-c
python scripts/p2p-three-node-regression.py
```

Bash on Linux, macOS, or WSL:

```bash
export P2P_DUAL_PUBLIC_HOST="${P2P_DUAL_PUBLIC_HOST:-host.docker.internal}"
docker compose -f docker-compose.p2p-dual.yml up -d --force-recreate dendrite-a dendrite-b dendrite-c
python3 scripts/p2p-three-node-regression.py
```

Run tests against a local PostgreSQL instance:

PowerShell:

```powershell
$env:POSTGRES_USER = "postgres"
$env:POSTGRES_PASSWORD = "123789"
$env:POSTGRES_HOST = "localhost"
$env:POSTGRES_PORT = "5432"
$env:POSTGRES_DB = "postgres"
go test ./p2p ./internal/productpolicy -count=1
```

Bash:

```bash
export POSTGRES_USER=postgres
export POSTGRES_PASSWORD=123789
export POSTGRES_HOST=localhost
export POSTGRES_PORT=5432
export POSTGRES_DB=postgres
go test ./p2p ./internal/productpolicy -count=1
```

Check documentation-only changes before committing:

```bash
git diff --check
```
